WLINK 10.0a has two completed native regression cases. The acceptance ledger
contains **566 application functions / 69,263 unique original code bytes**.
The initial help case is followed by a substantial NT console link with two
OMF objects, a static archive, imported functions, an exported symbol, cross-module
data and relocations, embedded Watcom debug information, and a verbose map.

| Case | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `0000-help` | Exit 0; exact 8,475-byte stdout, empty stderr, no artifacts |
| `0001-nt-link` | Exit 0; exact 243-byte stdout, empty stderr, 7,588-byte PE and 11,855-byte map |

The NT case compares every output byte except the identified four-byte COFF
timestamp and date/time digits in the map header. Its 551 first entries match.
The help reference was explicitly refreshed after correcting the genuine
BurnSystemList/PruneSystemList/CleanSystemList function boundaries; the earlier
raw capture is retained in scratch, not relabeled.

Build and replay from this directory:

```
make -j4 native cases build/WLINK.EXE
make -j4 check unit audit
```

Fixtures use the shared native i386 DSO runner and cached `capture.bin`, without
Wine. Original builds use the shared launcher/prefix, Watcom register ABI
(`-3r`) and disabled added stack checks (`-s`). Native GCC ABI is permitted at
the compatibility boundary. Actual argv, raw command line and the exact masked
self-image/resource overlay are captured separately.

Only the hash-pinned GS-compatible `.patched/WLINK.EXE` is captured; the pristine
binary remains unchanged. The four-site, nine-byte patch is limited to the
proved DS-backed 128-byte resource-reader owners reached by these cases.
Unknown callers remain guarded. Finite CRT restoration retains explicit older
library variants. Native nonlocal jump support is limited to value 1 in a live
Spawn context, without SEH unwinding or expired contexts.

The complete audit passes for 568 source-ready identities, their actual graph,
references, ownership and extents, returning-function cleanup and the separate
main-to-exit endpoint. Shared code counts once. SetBreak, ODBISectCleanup and
EndTime have explicitly seeded first-entry exclusions. The latter two are
statically qualified empty shared entries excluded from the acceptance count;
no observed separate invocation is claimed. The original first-node AddAddrInfo
sentinel read is preserved on Win32; its documented native-only deterministic
zero choice is limited to the observed invalid sentinel control read.

Final full audit/regression/unit batch: **0.689 s**, with four native invocations
of **18.787–29.432 ms**. The final NT original took **1,804.026 ms**; its native
comparison took **30.855 ms**, split **16.384 / 7.780 / 6.690 ms** for
setup/execution/checks. The original-compiler build and selected audit for the
last function took **0.901 / 0.094 s**. Raw artifacts, intermediate failures and
diagnostics remain under `~/.ai-tmp/msvc2/watcom-shared-integration/`.
