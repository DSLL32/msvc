CVPACK 5.10 reconstruction
========================

`make -j4 check unit` runs the cached cases and thirteen narrow native tests.
`make -j4 win32 audit` checks original-compiler compatibility and the function
graph/ABIs. Fixtures never invoke Wine.

134 accepted application functions total 42,862 original code bytes: 68.40% of the
62,662-byte whole-text extent. That denominator includes CRT/support, unknown
code and padding; a complete non-CRT denominator is not established. CRT/import
selection and the external MSPDB provider earn no application reconstruction credit.

Completed cases:

- 0000-help: status 1, 193 stdout bytes, empty stderr.
- 0001-hello-debug-dll: `/nologo hello.dll`, status 0, empty streams and exact NB11
  output SHA256 `935d7828c7003e4f951e79cb4a709c747eac8006405ac996299dea4e64dd0d40`.
- 0002-cpp-scene-growth: `/nologo growth.dll`, status 0, empty streams and exact
  285,168-byte output SHA256 `1cd8da46f548a48e42b79f8bb8a7c1191a323842f14c7675f0ab5e2dea3dc6cd`.
- 0004-catalog-bases: CRT-free `/nologo /v catalog.dll`, status 0, verbose
  statistics and a 151,600-byte packed DLL. Only the two proven unwritten
  SST_FILEINDEX alignment bytes at offsets151370..151372 are masked; native
  output must explicitly contain zeros there.

0002-cpp-scene-growth is a new three-module C++ workload with 240 telemetry
schemas, shared recursive types, virtual inheritance and large arrays. Original
packed CodeView is 238,240 bytes. Its source inputs remain capture assets. Numeric sizing, derived-base tracking,
temporary type-buffer allocation and buffered output were reached and reconstructed.
No Widen calls occur, and no oracle from the older DLL is installed for this input.

The DLL cases use a genuinely fresh reference with no explicit target environment
overrides from historical harness isolation. Prior captures remain in Git history.
Module-path setup is explicit host metadata, not target environment. Its retained
observed path is not asserted equal to historical or future staging paths; a
future actual application path consumer requires new input qualification.

The native MSPDB adapter remains a strict 21-lifetime typed response provider.
Only captured factory/Query/Emit/Release requests and complete inputs are allowed;
unknown calls fail. It writes observed prefixes and preserves each native buffer's
own unwritten capacity. It remains outside the application graph.

`src/` contains application code, `harness/` the native host/provider and ABI glue.
`crt/crt-imports.h` only declares the original direct `_iob` import, avoiding an
extra SDK accessor. Shipped MSVCRT supplies its implementation; no CRT body was
reconstructed. `binary.c` is the sole function/extent/status registry. Finite
rules remain in `policy-data.json`/`abi-policy.json`; the exact 8-byte Release tail
retains its reviewed residual, with strict cleanup checks on all other accepted bodies.

Latest catalog verification (2026-10-25): original capture 1.237s; native
replay29.406ms (setup5.063/execution19.236/checks5.107ms). Its base-relation
and mapped-file growth paths are complete. A separate PCH minimum-packing
diagnostic is unfinished pending its shared CRT copy boundary; its145-byte
lookup candidate is excluded from the accepted count above.

Full build/capture accounting stays in scratch. Historical per-function
state/proof campaigns are not rerun. Unvisited application stubs remain traps.
